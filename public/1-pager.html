	  <!-- 3-STEP PROCESS -->
	  <section>
		<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-200 mb-4">3-STEP PROCESS</h2>
		<ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-4 ml-4">
		  <li>
			<strong>Discovery &amp; Scoping (Free)</strong><br/>
			Fill out a concise intake form—state goals, timeline, and any must-haves.
			Jump on a brief call if necessary to nail down the vision and confirm scope.
			No cost until the project is fully defined and ready to begin.
			Then, set the weekly rate (starting at $2,000/week) based on project velocity and complexity.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<strong>Weekly Engagement &amp; Iteration</strong><br/>
			Follow the set weekly rate and cadence (~20 hrs/week). Each week focuses on strategy, design, and coding 
			aligned to the project’s evolving needs. Engagement can be ended early or extended based on how the project unfolds.
			Expect one scheduled check-in each week to review deliverables and keep alignment tight.
			All documentation remains clear and centralized, so decisions never fall through the cracks.
			Receive tangible prototypes—no waiting around for “final reveals.” Provide feedback; pivot if needed.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<strong>Handoff &amp; Next Steps</strong><br/>
			End with a functional MVP built on React + Tailwind (or your chosen stack).
			Perfect for demos, user testing, or handing off to an expanded team.
			Re-engage anytime for further features or deeper refinement.
		  </li>
		</ol>

		  <li>
			<strong>Focused Execution</strong><br/>
			Prioritizing fewer but more impactful features keeps projects lean and effective.
